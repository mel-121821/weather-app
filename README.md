# weather-app

Instructions:

[x] Set up a blank HTML document with the appropriate links to your JavaScript and CSS files.

[x] Write the functions that hit the API. You’re going to want functions that can take a location and return the weather data for that location. For now, just console.log() the information.

[x] Write the functions that process the JSON data you’re getting from the API and return an object with only the data you require for your app.

[x] Set up a form that will let users input their location and will fetch the weather info (still just console.log() it).

[] Display the information on your webpage!

[] While you don’t have to, if you wish to display weather icons then there can be a lot of them to import, so have a look at the dynamic import() function. Unlike plain template strings without an import, Webpack can read dynamic imports and still bundle all the relevant assets.

[] Add any styling you like!

[] Optional: add a ‘loading’ component that displays from the time the form is submitted until the information comes back from the API. Use DevTools to simulate network speeds.

[] Push to GitHub and share your solution!
